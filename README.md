# Doodledo

Doodledo is a project site that works as a platform to doodle asynchronously alone or with others.

Planned core functionality includes being able to create a profile, draw, and contribute to the drawings of others along with the necessary supporting features.
Possible additions are a friend system and thus, public and private doodles.

Based on [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/design/yfbQQpEJj9u7zcPfvJ29rI/Doodledo?node-id=38-221&t=tyLMjzgPYIqiJVRf-1).
